This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Note: This app uses json-server for development.
## If you want to test a build, run yarn json-serve before serving the build
## so it can access the simulated server json data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn json-serve`

Runs the json mock server with simulated json data (required to run build and dev modes)

### `yarn json-start`

Runs the app in development mode with json-server (using concurrently)<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Don't forget to run yarn json-serve to test the app
